Get familiar with GitHub

Hello there! My name is Sebastian Rodriguez Zapata. This GitHub serves as a nice testing ground for various projects that I will be completing for my last college semester. 
I am a cybersecurity senior at the Unversity of Cincinnati. Currently learning SQL, C#, Bash, and Python. 
Look forward to collaborating on exciting projects to polish our skills.
You can reach me at zapatasn@mail.uc.edu
